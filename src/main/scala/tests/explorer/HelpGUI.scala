      <b>Display</b>
    </p>
    <p>Each window corresponds to a directory in the filestore. Each of its files is shown on a single row in the display.
      The columns shown can be changed -- using the panel popped up by the
      <b>Îž</b>
      button. So can the order in which they are
      shown. Showing "invisible" files is enabled by
      <b>[.]</b>
      and disabled by
      <b>(.)</b>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      An
      <b>S</b>
      to the right of a date/time indicates
      daylight-saving (summer) time for the current locality on the given date.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <tt>size+</tt>
      column shows file sizes in compact human-readable form, namely a number followed by a suffix from
      <b>b k m g t</b>
      denoting
      its multiplication by a power of 10:
      <b>0 3 6 9 12</b>
      . Directory sizes are given as their number of files (with suffix
      <b>f</b>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>The path to the directory being viewed in the window is shown (above the listing) as a sequence of buttons, each of which corresponds to an
      ancestor and is associated with a "hover-hint" that shows the corresponding
      <i>real</i>
      path -- with symbolic links expanded when appropriate. Pressing any of them opens a fresh window on the ancestor.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Selection</b>
    </p>
    <p>Individual windows have a (possibly empty) selection: its rows are selected by mouse:</p>
    <scope>
      <attributes id="tag:p" hang=" *  "/>
      <p>Primary mouse click: selects uniquely</p>
      <p>Primary mouse drag: extends the selection</p>
      <p>Shifted primary mouse click: extends the selection at one end</p>
      <p>Secondary mouse click (or C-Primary) (or drag) inverts selection status of the indicated row(s)</p>
      <p>Mouse double-click, or (ENTER), opens the file indicated by the selected row, if possible</p>
    </scope>
    <p align="center">
      <b>Shelf</b>
    </p>
    <p>There is an Explorer-wide
      <b>Shelf</b>
      on which is a collection of paths that denote
      individual files in the filestore. A file is said to be "shelved" if its path is
      on the shelf. Shelved files are the objects of the actions describd below, and they are
      underlined in the display. If the underlining is "textured" then the corresponding file has been marked for deletion
      as part of the next "paste" (C-V).
    </p>

    <p>Actions are by buttons or keys.</p>
    <scope>
      <attributes id="tag:p" hang=" *  "/>
      <p>
        <b>Shelf</b>
        places the selection on the shelf.</p>
      <p>
        <b>C-C</b>
        places the selection on the shelf.</p>
      <p>
        <b>C-X</b>
        places the selection on the shelf, and marks it for later deletion as part of the next "paste" (C-V) action.</p>
      <p>
        <b>C-V</b>
        copies the shelved files to the folder in which it is clicked; deleting them if they were marked for deletion by (C-X).</p>
      <p>
        <b>del</b>
        deletes the shelved files.</p>
      <p>
        <b>cp mv ln</b>
        respectively copy, move, and link the shelved files to the
        current implicit destination. This is
        <i>either</i>
        the directory denoted by a single selected path in the window in which
        the button is pressed,
        <i>or if none is selected</i>
        the folder being shown in that window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Clear</b>
        removes the deletion mark from the shelf if it is so marked; otherwise clears the shelf.</p>
      <p>The usual navigation methods:
        <b>home end page-up page-down scroll-wheel</b>
        can be used to scroll the view; and the
        <b>up down</b>
        keys add to the selection in the specified direction if shifted; otherwise selecting a single row in the specified direction.
